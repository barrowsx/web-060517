Joining tables
  - how does a join/sql work and make queries
  - inner join
  - outer join

- Complex data model
  - Bar wants to keep track of the customers that bring in the most revenue, and the bartenders that bring in the most revenue.  It also wants to keep track of the cost of each drink - which will be calculated by adding each drink's ingredients.  
  As a bonus, also consider how we would structure the tables if we want to keep track of what orders are on what receipt.
  How do we model these tables?


bart simpson ordered a milk shake (vanilla ice cream and milk) from patty
lisa simpson ordered a rootbeer float (vanilla ice cream and root beer) from moe
